# 🏥 A Medical Document Conversational Framework Using MedGemma for Cancer Screening  
### Reliable Cancer Screening Assistance using MEDGemma + GenAI

A GenAI-powered medical document chatbot that helps users understand cancer screening related medical reports using **MedGemma (Google’s medical LLM)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

## 1️⃣ Introduction  
Medical reports are often difficult for non-experts to understand. This project builds a **medical document conversational AI system** that allows users to upload medical reports (PDFs, scanned images, DOCX) and ask questions related to **cancer screening**.  

By combining **document retrieval** with **MedGemma**, the system generates **context-aware and reliable answers** grounded in the uploaded medical content.

---

## 2️⃣ Overview  
The system follows a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline:

- User uploads a medical document  
- Text is extracted using PDF parsers and OCR  
- Document is split into chunks  
- Relevant chunks are retrieved using embeddings + FAISS  
- MedGemma LLM generates an answer using retrieved context  
- The response is delivered in a patient-friendly format  

This approach reduces hallucinations and improves trustworthiness.

**Pipeline:**  
User → Query Understanding → Document Retrieval → RAG Integration (MedGemma) → Answer Synthesis → Result Delivery
